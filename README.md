# Temp_FG-CNTR-TPMS-Plates
This repository provides the basic source code of the investigation on the temperature-dependent behaviors of functionaly graded carbon nanotube -reinforced triply periodic minimal surface (FG-CNTR-TPMS) plate structures with the following features:
- A new thermoelastic model for agglomerated randomly oriented CNT-reinforced materials;
- A novel multi-scale computational framework for FG-CNTR-TPMS lightweight composites.
- Five-variable higher-order shear deformation (HSDT) plate theory, isogeometric analysis (IGA);
- A new combined trigonometric and inverse-trigonometric shear deformation function;
- Thermal free vibration analyses of square FG-CNTR-TPMS plates with material temperature dependencies;
